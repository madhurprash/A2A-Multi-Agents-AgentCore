2. **.bedrock_agentcore.yaml**: AgentCore runtime configuration
   ```yaml
   agents:
     monitoring_agent:
       bedrock_agentcore:
         agent_arn: "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:123456789012:agent/agent-id"

### AWS Credentials
For live mode, ensure AWS credentials are configured:
```bash
aws configure
# OR
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

## üîç Technical Implementation

### Agent Invocation
The demo uses the actual monitoring agent logic from `monitoring_agent.py`:

```python
# Real agent invocation
response_text = ask_agent(message, session_id)

# Falls back to sophisticated demo responses
response = self._create_enhanced_demo_response(message)
```

### MCP Gateway Integration
Connects to AgentCore Gateway via MCP protocol:
```python
mcp_client = MCPClient(create_streamable_http_transport)
gateway_tools = mcp_client.list_tools_sync()
```

### Session Management
Maintains OTEL-compatible session tracking:
```python
ctx = baggage.set_baggage("session_id", session_id)
token = context.attach(ctx)
```

## üìä Demo Analytics

The application tracks:
- User interaction patterns
- Query types and frequency
- Response quality metrics
- Session duration and engagement
- Feature usage statistics

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Demo Scenarios
Extend `_create_enhanced_demo_response()` with new patterns:

```python
def _generate_custom_scenario_response(self, message: str) -> str:
    return """üîç **Custom Scenario Analysis**
    
    Your custom analysis here...
    """
```

### Styling Customization
Modify the CSS in the `st.markdown()` sections for custom branding:

```python
st.markdown("""
<style>
    .main-header {
        color: #YOUR_BRAND_COLOR;
    }
</style>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
```bash
streamlit run enhanced_streamlit_app.py --server.port=8502
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements_streamlit.txt
```

**Agent Connection Failed**
- Check AWS credentials
- Verify agent ARN in configuration
- Ensure MCP gateway is accessible
- Fall back to demo mode for presentations

**Configuration Not Found**
- Ensure `config.yaml` exists
- Check file paths in `constants.py`
- Verify YAML syntax
