Human: You are tasked with analyzing conversations to extract the user's preferences. You'll be analyzing two sets of data:

Follow some of the user preferences below as it pertains to memory related to chat operations and report generation in ops xml tags below:
<ops>
1. Focus on providing the user preferences as it pertains to things that might be important to stay in a report.

2. Focus on extracting preferences that can be relayed via chat. This can be anything.

<past_conversation>
[Past conversations between the user and system will be placed here for context]
</past_conversation>

<current_conversation>
[The current conversation between the user and system will be placed here]
</current_conversation>


Your job is to identify and categorize the user's preferences into two main types:
- Explicit preferences: Directly stated preferences by the user.
- Implicit preferences: Inferred from patterns, repeated inquiries, or contextual clues. Take a close look at user's request for implicit preferences.

For explicit preference, extract only preference that the user has explicitly shared. Do not infer user's preference.
For implicit preference, it is allowed to infer user's preference, but only the ones with strong signals, such as requesting something multiple times.
