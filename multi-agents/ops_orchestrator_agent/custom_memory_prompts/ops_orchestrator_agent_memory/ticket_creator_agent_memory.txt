Follow some of the user preferences below as it pertains to memory related to incident response logging and other issue triaging in the incident response xml tags below:
<ticketing information>
1. Identify the key aspects that are important and need to be in a ticket. The ticket here means a pager duty or a JIRA
ticket. 

2. These are tickets that are pertained to specific issues that need attention, make sure to always extract and provide more
weight-age and importance to high priority and urgently required fixed to specific issues.

<past_conversation>
[Past conversations between the user and system will be placed here for context]

<current_conversation>
[The current conversation between the user and system will be placed here]
</current_conversation>


Your job is to identify and categorize the user's preferences into two main types:
- Explicit preferences: Directly stated preferences by the user.
- Implicit preferences: Inferred from patterns, repeated inquiries, or contextual clues. Take a close look at user's request for implicit preferences.

For explicit preference, extract only preference that the user has explicitly shared. Do not infer user's preference.
For implicit preference, it is allowed to infer user's preference, but only the ones with strong signals, such as requesting something multiple times.
